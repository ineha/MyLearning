Queries -->
1.Show databases;
2.Create database [db_name] 
3 .Use [db_name]
4 .Create table [table_name] (col1,col2,col3);
5 .Eq user -  create table user(id int(11) primary key, name varchar(100) not null, city varchar(60));
6 .Desc [tb_name];
7 .Alter table [old table name] rename to [new table name];
8 .  truncate table student; ---> only data will be deleted not table
9 . drop table [table_name] ---> data aand table both will be deleted
10 .  insert into student (id,name,city) values(12,'neha','kanpur');
11. insert into student values(12,'neha','kanpur');
12.Primary key - > unique rhega id
13. alter table student add country varchar(50);
14.Update [table_name] set col=value, col=value where col=val (agar where ni lgayenge to pure columns update ho jayenge)
15. delete from [table_name] where col=value(agar where ni lgayenge to pure columns update ho jayenge).

Where: 
--->  select name as "username", city as "CITYNAME" from student;---> alias krn k liye--> thodi der k liye us col ka name change kr diya

 select distinct(col) from [table_name]; ----> distinct vlues

Between: 
 select *from student where id between 12 and 15(12 and 15 will be included);

IN:
 select *from student where id=12 or id=14 or id=15; OR  select *from student where id in(12,14,15);

Limit:
Limit mtlb kitne select krne h aur offset mtlb kitne chodne h
select *from student limit 2 offset 2;
